    "\n",
    "The dual optimization problem for the Soft-Margin SVM is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    " \\left \\{ \\begin{array}{l} \\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N} \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\intercal \\tilde{\\mathbf{K}} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\intercal \\mathbf{1} \\\\ \\text{ s.t. } \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\intercal \\mathbf{y} = 0 , 0 \\le \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\le C ,\n",
    " \\end{array} \\right .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\tilde{k}_{ij} = y_i y_j \\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This optimization problem is a QP problem, which is usually solved using an *ad hoc* algorithm: Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO).\n",
    "\n",
    "## SMO and Coordinate Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind SMO is that the optimization problem is too involved to be solved as a whole, but it can be largely simplified considering only a few variables at a time.\n",
    "In this divide-and-conquer approach, called coordinate descent, the objective function is iteratively minimized over the different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, SMO deals with two variables, the smaller working group that can be modified while respecting the constraints.\n",
    "Formally, the algorithm updates the current $\\alpha^\\text{old}_i$ and $\\alpha^\\text{old}_j$ coefficients to some new values $\\alpha_i$ and $\\alpha_j$, assuming that $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\text{old}$ satisfies $(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\text{old})^\\intercal \\mathbf{y} = 0$. In order to keep respecting the constraint in the new estimation, the following equation needs to be fulfilled:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    " & y_i \\alpha^\\text{old}_i + y_j \\alpha^\\text{old}_j = y_i \\alpha_i + y_j \\alpha_j \\\\\n",
    " &\\implies y_i (\\alpha_i - \\alpha^\\text{old}_i) = - y_j (\\alpha_j - \\alpha^\\text{old}_j) \\\\\n",
    " &\\implies \\alpha_i = \\alpha^\\text{old}_i - y_i y_j (\\alpha_j - \\alpha^\\text{old}_j) .\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, one can assume that the update for the $j$-th coefficient is given by $\\alpha_j = \\alpha^\\text{old}_j + d$, and hence the optimization problem becomes a simple one-dimensional minimization.\n",
    "Therefore, it can be solved by computing the derivative with respect to $d$ and equating to $0$.\n",
    "After some derivations, the optimum unconstrained update turns out to be:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    " d &= \\frac{y_j (E(\\mathbf{x}_j, y_j) - E(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i))}{\\kappa} , \\text{ where} \\\\\n",
    " \\kappa &= 2 \\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) - \\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_i) - \\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{x}_j, \\mathbf{x}_j) , \\text{ and} \\\\\n",
    " E(\\mathbf{x}, y) &= \\sum_{i = 1}^N \\alpha^\\text{old}_i y_i \\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}) - y .\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous update does not take into account the box constrains $0 \\le \\alpha_i, \\alpha_j \\le C$.\n",
    "In order to satisfy these constraints for both $\\alpha_i$ and $\\alpha_j$, $\\alpha_j$ has to be clipped to the interval $[L, H]$, where\n",
    "$$\n",
    " \\begin{cases}\n",
    "  L = \\max(0, \\alpha^\\text{old}_j - \\alpha^\\text{old}_i), & H = \\min(C, C - \\alpha^\\text{old}_i + \\alpha^\\text{old}_j) & \\text{if } y_i \\neq y_j , \\\\\n",
    "  L = \\max(0, \\alpha^\\text{old}_j + \\alpha^\\text{old}_i - C), & H = \\min(C, \\alpha^\\text{old}_i + \\alpha^\\text{old}_j) & \\text{if } y_i = y_j .\n",
    " \\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the update for $\\alpha_j$ becomes:\n",
    "$$ \\alpha_j = \\min(\\max(\\alpha^\\text{old}_j + d, L), H) , $$\n",
    "and, as mentioned above, the corresponding update for $\\alpha_i$ is:\n",
    "$$ \\alpha_i = \\alpha^\\text{old}_i - y_i y_j (\\alpha_j - \\alpha^\\text{old}_j) . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting the Working Pair\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different methods for selecting the working pair of coefficients $(i, j)$ that will be updated.\n",
    "Usually, first or second order information is used to choose the working set, trying to find those that will provide the largest minimization of the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, in this work a simplified version of SMO will be implemented.\n",
    "The first coefficient $i$ will be selected just iteratively, cycling over all the possible values $i = 1, 2, \\dotsc, N$. The second coefficient $j$ is selected randomly over the remaining possible values $j \\neq i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that this approach will not guarantee the convergence in general, since not all possible pairs $(i, j)$ are explored, but it will work in most problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stopping Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm will be terminated when a certain maximum number of iteration is reached (for each iteration, all the coefficients are updated), or when after one iteration the total change of the coefficients is smaller than a certain tolerance, $\\| \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} - \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\text{old}\\| < \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the working pair is generated randomly, it can happen that after a whole iteration the changes are smaller than $\\epsilon$ not because the optimization is finished, but because of \"bad luck\". A workaround is to set $\\epsilon = 0$ to force all the iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing the Intercept\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the optimum dual coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^*$ have been estimated, the intercept $b^*$ can be computed knowing that any support vector $\\mathbf{x}_k$ with $0 < \\alpha^*_k < C$ satisfies:\n",
    "$$ b^* = y_k - \\sum_{i = 1}^N \\alpha^*_i y_i \\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_k) . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equality is usually averaged over all the possible vectors $k$ satisfying $0 < \\alpha^*_k < C$ for reasons of numerical stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is trained and the optimal parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^*$ and $b^*$ are known, the score predicted over a new sample $\\mathbf{x}$ is:\n",
    "$$ f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^N \\alpha^*_i y_i \\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}) + b . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the class is assigned with:\n",
    "$$ \\hat{y} = \\operatorname{sign}(f(\\mathbf{x})) . $$"
